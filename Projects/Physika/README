1. This directory contains .sln files to build the projects in vs2010
2. And later it would be replace by the CMakelists as soon as the CMake is practical.
3. clean_tempfile.bat gives you a way to delete all the temp files when VS builds. 

4. ******Remember to run the clean when you update the projects******.
