=============================================================

**Code Structure:**

*documentation*: documentations related to this project, including coding style and development plans.

*libaries*: body of Physika

- *include*: header files generated by Physika after compilation. Any project built on Physika simply needs to include files in this directory.
	
- *bin*: binary files generated by Physika after compilation.
	
- *src*: source code of Physika, including 3rd party libraries that Physika uses. After compilation, header files and binary libraries would be copied to the 2 directories above. Of course, trough automatic tools such as makefile.

*projects*: projects built on Physika. Generally they simply need to include necessary header files and link corresponding binaries of Physika.
